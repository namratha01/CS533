Course Project - Concurrency

Create 5 applications (use python, java, C or whatever you want) and have them use each major type of unix communication to solve two classic concurrency/synchronization problems: producer-consumer and dining philosophers. Do this with pipes, shared memory, shared file,
TCP and MPI. Devise a way to test the correctness of each solution to each problem. Measure and compare performance and usability of each approach.
